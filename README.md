# Defending the Network
For this project, our team performed the role of security engineers for a fictious organization called X-Corp. We first worked as a red team to perform a penetration test on a vulnerable machine called the ‘Capstone’ machine. The target machine captured logs of our activity as we attacked vulnerable VMs that exposed our network services. For the second portion, we functioned as a blue team to use our ELK set up from our previous project to log data & visualizations from our Kibana dashboard into a report. We utilized tools like Filebeat & Metricbeat to further parse through our large data pool for relevant discrepancies within our SOC infrastructure.   

The first link is our deliverable, providing a summary of our network & it's vulnerabilities while the second is a report presenting our log data along with suggested mitigation proposals for each exploit performed.
